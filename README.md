# Predicting drug-drug interaction using Graph Neural Network


## Introduction
* Drug-Drug interaction is one of the most sought out areas due to its immense relevance.
* It is defined by the reaction between two or more drugs when in contact with one another. These interactions can either be supportive, or might lead to hazardous consequences.
* The use of graph neural networks instead of traditional manual techniques not only makes the process more efficient, but also helps in enhancing the accuracy by including connections that would not have been seen by manual approaches.
* We aim to build graph based link predictions and generate a comparative study of the same.

## Dataset
* Ogblâ€“ddi from Open Graph Benchmark 
    - Nodes - 4267
    - Edges - 13,34,889
* It is a homogenous, undirected, unweighted graph
representing drug-drug interactions.
